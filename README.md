## About the project
The FEMO iOS application allows a player to play against the computer by answering programming related questions. It is played turn by turn, if you answer correclty your player moves by the number of the dice roll if not you stay put, then the computer takes it's turn. The end goal is to reach the rocket, however along the path you'll find blackholes which push the players three steps backwards if landed on. While playing the game you are able to move back and forth between the menu page and the information page without affecting the position of the players.

## About the project
While building this project we encountered challenges when merging branches, to save time and put the project back on track we created a new repo (this one), added the .gitignore and .gitattributes files and moved over the files. We kept the previous repo (link above) as it is a part of our initial project.
